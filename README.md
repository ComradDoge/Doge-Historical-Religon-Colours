    NOT IRONMAN COMPATIBLE | In MPs all require it
    This is a mod that updates the mod by reddbane to work on 1.30 Emperor Patch as Hussite religion broke the file.

    My Changes:
    - Hindu colour changed due to simillarities with Hussite
    - Theravada yellow made slightly darker for more contrast
    - Zoroastrian colour reverted back to vanilla

    Full credit goes to reddbane.
